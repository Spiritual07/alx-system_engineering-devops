# Firewalls can not only filter requests, they can also forward them.

# Requirements:

# Configure web-01 so that its firewall redirects port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP.

# enable IP-FORWARDING
# Before setting up port forwarding, ensure that IP forwarding is enabled. Edit the /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf file and uncomment or ad# d the following line to enable IP forwarding:

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Save and close the file, then apply the changes by running:

sudo sysctl -p

# Set up Port Forwarding using iptables

sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80

# Save iptables Rules

sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

# Verify Port Forwarding

sudo iptables -t nat -L
